# Uppercase custom directive

This example server from the [Apollo documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/creating-directives/) demonstrates an implementation of a custom `@upper` directive that transforms a `String` GraphQL field to uppercase.

Run this example with `yarn start` or `node index.js`.
